# setupScript

### This script started off just as a bash script but quickly got turned into a script for my raspberry pi, Arch and Manjaro installation along with windows too. Feel free to fork it and turn it into your own thing.

---

I have 3 folders for 3 different platforms, I have Arch, raspberry pi and windows and in those folders are the scripts to install software and some configuration file. 

## Arch

I'm fairly new to Arch Linux itself but I did use manjaro before that, so for now I have a manjaro script and a semi complete Arch linux `installation guide`.

## Windows
I have grown to hate windows but anything to make the reinstall easier is something I'm willing to take, I have a package list for `chocolatey` and another for `winget` choose whichever one you like more but they're both pretty bad if I am being honest. Inside that I also have the settings for my windows terminal and the font it uses.

## Raspberry PI
Something I realized pretty quickly after I messed up and had to reinstall the raspian OS is that reinstall is far more painful then it needs to be, some settings you just never remember, I just made bash scripts that take care of my `samba` setup, `autostart` scripts and a `fan controller`.

If any of these things are helpful feel free to fork my project and change it to your liking or feel free to suggest improvements I'm sure there are more than I think there are. Also this isn't meant to be something great, it's just my personal scripts that I don't mind sharing so treat it as that. 

Thanks for reading! have a nice day.
