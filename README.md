# ultimateBashScript
The ultimate bash script for my Raspberry pi or anything else that has linux on it. Goal is to make one script that'll set everything up as I like it. This generally sets up screen, micro, samba for now. The script isn't perfect and doesn't have many checks that it should have, I'll update it as time goes, feel free to contribute useful changes I'll make sure to take it into consideration.
